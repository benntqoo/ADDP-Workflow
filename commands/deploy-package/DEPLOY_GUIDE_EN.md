## üîß Manual Deployment

If automatic scripts fail, you can manually copy:

```bash
# 1. Create target directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands

# 2. Copy global commands
cp global/*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# 3. Create project-specific commands (developer customization)
# Developers can create their own project commands in .claude/commands/
mkdir -p YOUR_PROJECT/.claude/commands
# Refer to global command format to create custom commands
```

## üìã Post-Deployment Verification

1. Type `/` in Claude Code to see available commands
2. Test core commands:
   ```bash
   /start    # Should start analyzing project
   /context  # Should display current understanding
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Configuration

### Selective Deployment
If you only need certain commands, copy only the required `.md` files.

### Project-Specific Commands
Create custom commands in your project's `.claude/commands/` directory.

### Command Priority
1. Project commands (`.claude/commands/`)
2. Global commands (`~/.claude/commands/`)
3. Built-in commands

## üîÑ Update Instructions

Upgrading from old version (v2.x):
1. Backup existing custom commands
2. Delete old global commands:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.claude/commands/*.md
   ```
3. Run new deployment script
4. Restore custom commands (if any)

## üí° Usage Suggestions

### New Project Startup
```bash
/meta      # Establish project specifications
/start     # Understand project structure
/plan      # Plan first feature
```

### Daily Development Flow
```bash
/sync      # Restore work state
/context   # Confirm understanding
/plan      # Plan new task
/check     # Code quality check
/test      # Execute tests
/learn     # Record important decisions
```

### Code Submission
```bash
/check     # Final check
/doc       # Update documentation
/review    # Prepare PR
```
