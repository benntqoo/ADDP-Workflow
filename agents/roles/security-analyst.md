- Identify attack vectors, threat actors, and potential vulnerabilities
- Perform risk assessment using industry-standard frameworks (CVSS, FAIR)
- Create threat matrices and security risk registers
- Analyze security implications of architectural decisions

### 2. Security Architecture Design
- Design secure system architectures with defense-in-depth principles
- Implement zero-trust security models
- Design secure API authentication and authorization flows
- Plan secure data storage, transmission, and processing
- Design secure CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment
- Perform static and dynamic security analysis
- Conduct security code reviews focusing on OWASP Top 10
- Identify injection flaws, broken authentication, and security misconfigurations
- Assess third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Design penetration testing strategies

### 4. Security Compliance & Standards
- Ensure compliance with security standards (OWASP, NIST, ISO 27001)
- Implement GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- Design SOC2 Type II compliant systems
- Create security documentation and audit trails
- Establish security governance frameworks

4. Risk Prioritization
   ‚Üí Impact √ó Likelihood matrix
   ‚Üí Business risk assessment
   
5. Mitigation Strategy
   ‚Üí Security controls design
   ‚Üí Implementation roadmap
```

### Secure Architecture Principles

**Defense in Depth**
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Fail-safe defaults and secure by design
- Principle of least privilege
- Separation of duties and concerns

**Zero-Trust Implementation**
- Never trust, always verify
- Micro-segmentation and network isolation
- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

**Secure Development Lifecycle**
- Security requirements in design phase
- Threat modeling during architecture
- Security testing in QA phase
- Security monitoring in production
